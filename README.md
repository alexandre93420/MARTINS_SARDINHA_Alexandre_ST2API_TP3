# OpenWeather
The most difficult for me in the tp2 is due to a mistake of my part because I I had understood that the city was at the choice of the user, so the hardest was to make the call to the API which will give me the locs of the cities in fontion of their names.

So it was the most difficult for me.

•What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles? What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”? What’s clean code, clean architecture?

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

 the kiss encourages simplicity in design and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided as much as possible.

I think, to improve it I really want to implement a map like google earth an the user can maybe click in a city on the map and see the weather.
