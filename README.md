# OpenWeather
The most difficult for me in the tp2 is due to a mistake of my part because I I had understood that the city was at the choice of the user, so the hardest was to make the call to the API which will give me the locs of the cities in fontion of their names.

So it was the most difficult for me.

•What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles? What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”? What’s clean code, clean architecture?

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

 the kiss encourages simplicity in design and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided as much as possible.

I think, to improve it I really want to implement a map like google earth an the user can maybe click in a city on the map and see the weather.


To start the app, please enter your API Key in : MARTINS_SARDINHA_Alexandre_ST2API_TP3\MyWeather\Services\WeatherService.cs , in line 13.

When you start the app, first you have to add cities by name (english) and the loc lat lon.
To do this you have to go on the menu of the app top left hard corner then click on configure, add city.
When your cities are added:
Go back on weather. Click on get weather. You have now the weather of all of cities entered.
If you want more details, you have to click on the city you want, you can now see more information about the meteo of the city like forecast 5 days or sunrise utc.
